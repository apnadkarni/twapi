<h1>Tcl Windows Help</h1>
<p>This is a compilation of the documentation for Tcl/Tk and the most commonly
used extensions and libraries on Windows. Advantages over various other
documentation sources are:
<ul>
  <li>Includes Tcl/Tk, standard libraries and the most commonly used
    Windows extensions in a single help file.</li>
  <li>Comprehensive table of contents. Commands or C
    functions within a single page have individual
    entries. Subcommands, (for example, <code>string match</code>),
    widget options (for example, <code>-activebackground</code>),
    and important details
    (for example, <code>%f</code> focus specifier) have their own
    entries for ease of lookup.</li>
  <li>A combined and detailed index makes
    it easy to locate specific information. For example,
    typing <code>try</code> in the index input box will bring up links
    to both the TWAPI and Tcl versions of the command.
    Similarly, typing <code>%EE</code> will allow quick access to
    the detail for how
    this specifier is handled by the <code>clock</code> command and
    typing &lt;&lt;MenuSelection&gt;&gt; will take you to the description
    for that event.
    Together with incremental lookup, this
    makes locating information very quick and easy.</li>
  <li>Full text content search.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Documentation for the following distributions are included:
<ul>
  <li>Tcl/Tk 8.6 including TDBC and Itcl</li>
  <li>Tcl Windows API 3.0</li>
  <li>Tcllib 1.12</li>
  <li>Tklib 0.5</li>
</ul>
