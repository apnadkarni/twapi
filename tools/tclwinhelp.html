<h1>Tcl Windows Help (V 2015.03.27)</h1>
<p>This is a compilation of the documentation for Tcl/Tk and the most commonly
used extensions and libraries on Windows. Advantages over various other
documentation sources are:
<ul>
  <li>Comprehensive, detailed table of contents. In particular, Tcl commands
    or C functions within a single page have individual entries. For example,
    <ul>
      <li>Subcommands, such as <tt>string match</tt></li>
      <li>Widget options, such as <tt>-activebackground</tt></li>
      <li>Options and specifiers, such as <tt>%f</tt> focus specifier</li>
    </ul>
    all have their own entries.</li>
  <li>A combined and detailed index makes
    it easy and quick to locate specific information. For example,
    <ul>
      <li>Combined index - typing <tt>try</tt> in the index input box will show the
	the TWAPI as well as Tcl versions of <tt>try</tt>.</li>
      <li>Index includes subcommands - <tt>string match</tt> links directly to the
	description of the <tt>match</tt> subcommand of the <tt>string</tt>
	command.
      <li>Entries for options, format or event specifiers, bindings etc. -  <tt>%EE</tt> links to the
	description for
	this specifier in the <tt>clock</tt> command documentation. Similarly,
	<tt>&lt;&lt;MenuSelect&gt;&gt;</tt> will take you to the description
	for that event.</li>
    </ul>
    Together with incremental lookup, this
    makes locating information very quick and easy.</li>
  <li>Full text content search.</li>
</ul>
</p>
