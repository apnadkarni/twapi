<h1>Tcl Windows Help</h1>
<p>This is a compilation of the documentation for Tcl/Tk and the most commonly
used extensions and libraries on Windows. Advantages over various other
documentation sources are:
<ul>
  <li>Comprehensive, detailed table of contents. In particular, Tcl commands
    or C functions within a single page have individual entries. For example,
    <ul>
      <li>Subcommands, such as <code>string match</code></li>
      <li>Widget options, such as <code>-activebackground</code></li>
      <li>Options and specifiers, such as <code>%f</code> focus specifier</li>
    </ul>
    all have their own entries.</li>
  <li>A combined and detailed index makes
    it easy and quick to locate specific information. For example,
    <ul>
      <li>Typing <code>try</code> in the index input box will bring up links
	to both the TWAPI and Tcl versions of the command.</li>
      <li>Typing <code>%EE</code> directly links to the detailed description for
	this specifier in the <code>clock</code> command documentation.</li>
      <li>Typing &lt;&lt;MenuSelection&gt;&gt; will take you to the description
	for that event.</li>
    </ul>
    Together with incremental lookup, this
    makes locating information very quick and easy.</li>
  <li>Full text content search.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Documentation for the following distributions are included:
<ul>
  <li>Tcl/Tk 8.6 including TDBC and Itcl</li>
  <li>Tcl Windows API 3.0</li>
  <li>Tcllib 1.12</li>
  <li>Tklib 0.5</li>
</ul>
