To use comtest in the test script, it has to be registered on the system.
comtest is a 32-bit component. Registration depends on whether running 
32- or 64-bit Tcl and whether run inproc (32-bit only) or outproc.

(These instructions are based on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4043954/how-to-use-a-32-bit-com-object-on-windows-server-2008-works-on-2008-r2-but-non)

Running inproc on 32-bit systems
--------------------------------
Run
  regsvr32 comtest.dll

To uninstall
  regsvr32 /u comtest.dll

Create a object
  set o [comobj Twapi.Test]
or
  set o [comobj Twapi.Test -model inprocserver]

Running outproc on 32-bit systems
---------------------------------
This will run comtest.dll inside of dllhost. See page 189 of Troelsen's
Developers Workshop for COM and ATL 3.0 for details

Run
  regsvr32 comtest.dll
Then run oleview, click on "All Objects", and select the Twapi.Test node.
In the right hand pane, Select the Implementation->Inproc Server tab, and
enable the "Use Surrogate Process" checkbox.

Alternatively, see the registry editing instructions in Troelsen (similar
to the 64-bit notes below)

Create a object
  set o [comobj Twapi.Test -model localserver]

Verify that new dllhost process was started up. 

Running inproc on 64-bit systems
---------------------------------
Not possible.

Running outproc on 64-bit Tcl
-----------------------------
This will run comtest.dll inside of dllhost. Since comtest is a 32-bit
component, the 32-bit registry must be used. Note the *paths* below

Run
  c:\windows\syswow64\regsvr32 comtest.dll

1. Start the 32-bit regedit (c:\windows\syswow64\regedit)
2. Locate the key HKey_Classes_Root\Wow6432Node\CLSID\[GUID] where [GUID]
is the TwapiTest coclass guid (currently {310FEA61-BC62-4944-84BE-D9DB986701DC})
NOTE presence of Wow6432Node in the path.
3. Add a new REG_SZ (string) value called AppID to the key with [GUID] from
above as the value (actually it can be any GUID, not necessarily the one above)
4. Add a new key HKey_Classes_Root\Wow6432Node\AppID\[GUID] where [GUID] is
the [GUID] from step 3 (may or may not be the TwapiTest GUID)
5. Add a string Value entry DllSurrogate to this key, leaving its value empty
6. (This step is optional I think - only necessary if running as admin with
UAC disabled). Similar to above, add DllSurrogate to
HKey_Local_Machine\Wow6432Node\Software\Classes\AppID\[GUID]

Now when you create your COM object you should see DLLHost.exe*32 show
up in task manager. Turn on the command-line column in task manager
and you should see 
C:\windows\syswow64\dllhost.exe /processid:{YourCOMGUIDHere}
