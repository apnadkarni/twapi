NOTE: Build instructions for TWAPI 3.0 have changed significantly from
previous versions. The source code management system has also moved from CVS 
to Mercurial.

What you need (or the official build environment):
--------------------------------------------------

- To compile the 32-bit version of TWAPI, you need Visual C++ 6.0. The 64-bit
version is built with the compiler that ships with the SDK. The primary
reason for not moving to later versions of Visual Studio is that these
compilers use C runtime libraries that are present on every version
of Windows. Later versions would require to ship the Microsoft runtime
redistributable package.

- Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 SP1. Earlier versions
will not do. Later versions will but you may need to do some tweaking.
It is unfortunate that you need to install a 350MB package just for
some headers and libraries but that's life. When installing, make sure
you include the AMD64 build environment if you want to do 64-bit
builds. Also ensure you include the Web Workshop component as some
Windows Shell headers are included there.

- Some version of Mercurial to check code from the SourceForge repository.

- Note a Tcl installation is no longer required. Appropriate headers and
libraries are contained within the TWAPI directories.

Here is the step-by-step procedure for compiling twapi on a PC:

Source code checkout
--------------------

Clone the twapi repository from SourceForge.

If you are using the command line Mercurial client, the command would be

    hg clone http://twapi.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/twapi/twapi my_twapi

This will create a my_twapi/ subdirectory in your current working
directory.

For more detail about using Mercurial, you might want to
start with the SourceForge Mercurial instructions at
http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Mercurial.


Customize for your environment
------------------------------

Edit the files twapi/common.inc and twapi/makefile to fix up paths
specific to your environment. This is generally not required. If you
are building full distributions, the zip and unzip commands are expected
to be in your path. Otherwise, edit twapi/makefile to point them to
the right place.


Set up 32-bit environment (only for 32-bit builds)
-------------------------

In a DOS command window, set up the build environment by typing the commands

     "c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\vc98\vcvars32"
     "c:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\setenv.cmd" /2000 /RETAIL

Note the locations of the Visual Studio and SDK directories may be different
on your system.


Set up 64-bit environment (only for 64-bit builds)
-------------------------

In a DOS command window, set up the build environment by typing the command

     "c:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\setenv.cmd" /XP64 /RETAIL

NOTE: /XP64 and /RETAIL MUST BE IN UPPER CASE.

The locations of the Visual Studio and SDK directories may be different
on your system.

Building the extension
----------------------

There are several different variations of the extensions. These are
described in the documentation in detail. Briefly, in the first
variation, the Tcl script components in TWAPI are stored as separate
files. The script files then load the DLL. This is "traditional" way
mixed binary/script Tcl packages are distributed. In the second case,
the scripts are embedded in the DLL itself as a resource so a single
DLL is all the application needs. The third case is similar except
that the scripts are stored in compressed form in the resource resulting
in a smaller footprint.

To build each of these, in either the 32- or 64-bit command windows above,
cd to the twapi directory and type

    nmake

to build the first variation. Type

   nmake EMBED_SCRIPT=plain

to build the second, and type

   nmake EMBED_SCRIPT=lzma

to build the third. Note any other value of EMBED_SCRIPT will have the
same effect as not defining it at all.

The DLL will be built in the base\X86\release, base\x86\release_embed
and base\x86\release_embed_lzma respectively. The 64-bit builds will
use the AMD64 subdirectories instead of x86.

In all cases, the documentation will be built under the doc subdirectory.

Packaging the distribution
--------------------------

For this step, you will need to edit the makefile to point
to zip.exe compression program and run the commands

    nmake distribution
    nmake tmdistribution

The first command will build TWAPI .zip distributions under the temp
subdirectory. For 64-bit builds, the distribution will be placed under
temp\win64.  The second command will build a Tcl 8.5 Tcl module
instead of a .zip distribution. Both these commands are independent of
the other.
