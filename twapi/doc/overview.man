The Tcl Windows API (TWAPI) extension provides access to functions in the
Windows API from within the Tcl scripting language.

[para]
The extension provides access to the Windows API at two levels:
[list_begin bullet]
[bullet] a [uri raw.html "raw interface"]
to the supported Windows API is provided where the
Tcl commands directly map to Windows functions. Programmers who are
familiar with the Win32 API and prefer to do things the hard way may
prefer to use this interface.
[bullet] a more convenient and powerful higher level interface
that makes the API much more accessible. This is the interface
documented in the remaining sections.
