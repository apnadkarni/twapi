* About Tcl
** What is Tcl and why should I learn it?
Tcl is a high-level dynamic language that runs on a wide variety of platforms,
from mainstream operating systems like Unix/Linux, Windows and MacOS 
to embedded systesm like Cisco routers. Code written on one platform
will run practically unchanged on another. Tcl's simple but powerful
and expressive nature make it suitable for applications ranging from
customized systems administration utilities to standalone desktop applications
to scalable, distributed servers.

** Why should I use Tcl instead of VBScript or PowerShell?
There are several reasons why you might want to use Tcl instead
of PowerShell or VBScript for scripting tasks on Windows. First,
Tcl deployment is simple, with the option of a
single executable distribution that includes your scripts and with
no external dependencies. This allows
deployment even to systems such as Windows 2008 Server Core which did
not support PowerShell due to its dependence on the .NET framework.
Second, because of its use of native Windows interfaces, Tcl is
lightweight and efficient in use of system resources including CPU,
memory and disk. Third, generic scripts such as
for XML processing, will run on non-Windows platforms without
any modifications.

** Why should I use Tcl instead of C#/C++/VB.Net
   Simply put, the three P's:
   - Productivity - Tcl's dynamic nature, expressiveness and
		     high level constructs greatly increase programming
		     productivity with shorter development cycles
		     and greater robustness.
   - Portability - large portions of your code base, and even entire
		    applications are portable to other platforms with minimal
		    effort.
