-------------

TWAPI is distributed in multiple formats.

  * A ZIP archive, "twapi-VERSION.zip", that includes the Tcl scripts
    (including test scripts) in source form and is platform independent,
    containing both 32- and 64-bit DLLs.
  * A ZIP archive, "twapi-VERSION-bin.zip", in which the Tcl scripts
    are embedded within the DLL. This is also platform independent and
    simultaneuosly supports both 32- and 64-bit Tcl.
  * A single file Tcl module, "twapi-PLATFORM-VERSION.tm", for Tcl 8.5
    and above. This is platform-specific (separate 32- and 64-bit versions)
  * A standalone DLL, "twapi-PLATFORM-VERSION.dll", that can be
    directly loaded into any supported version of Tcl. This is also 
    platform specific.
