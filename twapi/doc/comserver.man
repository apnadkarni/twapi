This module provides commands for implementing COM clients and servers
in Tcl. For writing COM clients, see the [uri com.html "COM client"] module.

TWAPI's COM server support enables writing COM components in Tcl
that can be accessed by any COM client that can access COM automation
components through the IDispatch interface.
[para]
This documentation is reference material that assumes familiarity with
COM programming concepts such as COM interfaces, automation, PROGID
and CLSID identifier types and so on. For more introductory material
and a guide with examples, see the COM chapter in the
[uri http://www.magicsplat.com/book "Tcl on Windows"] online book.

[section "Overview"]

COM components may be implemented as DLL's which run inside the client
process, termed [emph in-process], or as separate processes, termed as
[emph localserver] or [emph out-of-process]. TWAPI only supports the
implementation of the latter type of component.

Information about COM components is stored in the Windows registry
including the DLL or executable in which it is implemented.
When a client attempts to create a COM object that is implemented as
an out-of-process component, the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM)
looks up executable command line for the passed CLSID in the registry
and starts up a new process if there is
not one already running that can service the request. The new process
registers [emph "class factories"] with the SCM for each type of
component implemented by the process 
(a single executable may house more than one component classes).
The appropriate class factory is
then invoked to create an object which is then returned to the client.

Implementing a COM component thus involves:

[list_begin bullet]
[bullet]
Writing the Tcl code that provides the functionality of the component(s)
[bullet]
Installing the component by registering its class with the Service
Control Manager (SCM).
[bullet]
Registering the component class [emph "factory objects"] with the
SCM when the process is started
[bullet]
Cleanly shutting down when so notified by the SCM.
[list_end]

Note that implementing a component using TWAPI does [emph not] require
you to write an IDL file or generate a COM type library.

[section "Implementing component functionality"]

The core functionality can be implemented by any Tcl command, with
optional prefix arguments, that takes some action or
returns a result based on a method or property name and
their parameters that are passed as additional arguments.
Thus it may be implemented by a TclOO object,
a namespace ensemble or even a simple proc with a switch statement.
Thus the following class suffices as a COM object.
[example_begin]
oo::class create Calculator {
    variable Interp
    constructor {} {
        set Interp [lb]interp create -safe[rb]
    }
    method add args {
        return [lb]$Interp eval [lb]list ::tcl::mathop::+ {*}$args[rb][rb]
    }
    method multiply args {
        return [lb]$Interp eval [lb]list ::tcl::mathop::* {*}$args[rb][rb]
    }
}
[example_end]
Note this class is oblivious to the fact that it is a COM object.



[section Commands]

[list_begin definitions]

[call [cmd comserver_factory] [arg CLSID] [arg MEMBER_MAP] [arg CREATE_COMMAND] [opt [arg FACTORYNAME]]]

Creates a COM component factory that will be used by COM clients to 
create objects of the COM class identified by [arg CLSID]. [arg MEMBER_MAP]
is a dictionary mapping integer DISPID values to the method and property
names for the class. [arg CREATE_COMMAND] is a command prefix that is to
be invoked in the global namespace
to create new objects when requested by COM clients. Note these
objects do not have to be TclOO objects but any command form that can
be invoked by appending the appropriate method name from [arg MEMBER_MAP]
and arguments passed by the client. For example, a suitably implemented
namespace ensemble would do as well.
[nl]
The return value is a factory command object with two methods, neither
of which take arguments. The [cmd register] method should be used to register
the factory with the system's Service Control Manager (SCM) so that it can
invoked to create new objects on a client's request. The registration
is only activated after the application calls
[uri #run_comservers [cmd run_comservers]].
The other method
is [cmd destroy] which should be called when the factory is to be unregistered 
with the SCM. This [emph must] be called before the application exits.
[nl]
Other methods of the command object are intended for internal use and 
should not be directly invoked.

[call [cmd install_comserver] [arg PROGID] [arg CLSID] [arg VERSION] [opt [arg options]]]
Installs the specified component on a system so it can be invoked by 
COM clients. The following options may be specified with the command:
[list_begin opt]
[opt_def [cmd -command] [arg COMMANDLINE]]
Specifies 
that the SCM should start a process to handle client requests for the
component. [arg COMMANDLINE] should be the program and
associated parameters for the process to be started.
This option is mutually exclusive with the [cmd -service] option.
[opt_def [cmd -scope] [arg SCOPE]]
If [arg SCOPE] is [const user] (default), the component is installed
only for the current user. If [arg SCOPE] is [const system] it is
installed for the entire system.
[opt_def [cmd -service] [arg SERVICENAME]]
Installs the component as a service. When a client attempts to access
the component, the SCM will start the service [arg SERVICENAME]. Note
that the service itself must have been 
[uri services.man#create_service installed] previously. This option
is mutually exclusive with [cmd -command].
[list_end]

[call [cmd resume_factories]]
Activates all COM factories in the process so that they can respond to
client requests.

[call [cmd start_factories] [opt [arg CMDPREFIX]]]

Activates all COM factories in the process so that they can respond to
client requests. If no arguments are specified, the command will not
return as long as there are COM servers active. It will run the Tcl
event loop servicing requests until all clients have disconnected.
If [arg CMDPREFIX] is specified, the command returns right away after
activating the COM factories. In this case, the caller is responsible
for running the event loop so that client requests can be processed.
[arg CMDPREFIX] is a command prefix that
will be called when all clients have disconnected and it is safe to
exit.

[call [cmd suspend_factories]]
Temporarily suspends all COM factories in the process. They will
not respond to requests for creating objects until 
they are reactivated with [uri #resume_factories [cmd resume_factories]].

[call [cmd uninstall_comserver] [arg PROGID] [opt "[cmd -scope] [arg SCOPE]"]]
Uninstalls the specified component from the system. [arg SCOPE] may
be [const user] (default) or [const system] as described in
[uri #install_comserver [cmd install_comserver]].
