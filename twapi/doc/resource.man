[description]
[para]

Windows resources are binary data that can be added to executable files.
Examples include icons, strings and fonts.
This module provides commands related to manipulation of these
resources.

[section "Windows Resources"]
Resources are stored in Portable Executable format files (exe's and dll's).
A resource has an associated name, type and a language.
The name and type can be either integer values or strings.
To retrieve a particular resource, you must know both the associated
values, the type and the name, for that resource. When a resource type
or name is a string, it must be explicitly enclosed in quotes. For example,
[example "::twapi::read_resource \$h 14 {\"ICON3\"} 0"]
and not
[example "::twapi::read_resource \$h 14 \"ICON3\" 0"]
or
[example "::twapi::read_resource \$h 14 ICON3 0"]

[para]
To support
localization, there can be several resources with the same type and
name, but associated with different languages. These languages are
identified by a 16 bit language identifier ([cmd LANGID]) as 
described in the TWAPI [uri nls.html Internationalization] documentation.

[para]
TWAPI provides commands to retrieve and update resources as binary data.
It does not provide any functionality related to constructing the actual
binary data itself. Each resource type has a specific structure and
it is up to the application to construct it appropriately.

[para]
In addition to the commands to load resources as binary data,
TWAPI also provides commands to load certain resource types -
icons, cursors and bitmaps - as GDI objects accessed through handles
by other functions in the Windows API.

[section "Resource Types"]

Windows defines certain standard resource types shown in the table below
along with the corresponding [const #define] values from the SDK.

[list_begin opt]
[opt_def 1] RT_CURSOR - Cursor
[opt_def 2] RT_BITMAP - Bitmap
[opt_def 3] RT_ICON - Icon
[opt_def 4] RT_MENU - Menu
[opt_def 5] RT_DIALOG - Dialog
[opt_def 6] RT_STRING - String (see [uri #stringresources "String Resources"])
[opt_def 7] RT_FONTDIR - Font directory
[opt_def 8] RT_FONT - Font
[opt_def 9] RT_ACCELERATOR - Accelerator
[opt_def 10] RT_RCDATA - Application defined raw data
[opt_def 11] RT_MESSAGETABLE - Message table
[opt_def 12] RT_GROUP_CURSOR - Hardware independent cursor
[opt_def 14] RT_GROUP_ICON - Hardware independent icon
[opt_def 16] RT_VERSION - Version
[opt_def 17] RT_DLGINCLUDE - Name of C include file containing corresponding symbolic names of resources
[opt_def 19] RT_PLUGPLAY - Plug and play
[opt_def 20] RT_VXD - Vxd
[opt_def 21] RT_ANICURSOR - Animated cursor
[opt_def 22] RT_ANIICON - Animated icon
[opt_def 23] RT_HTML - HTML
[opt_def 24] RT_MANIFEST - Executable Manifest
[list_end]

[section "Locating and Loading Resources"]
Manipulating a resource requires a Windows executable module
handle for the corresponding
executable file. The commands will accept [const NULL] or [const 0]
for this handle corresponding the the main executable for the process.
To retrieve resources in other executables or DLL's, the module
must be first loaded through the
[uri process.html#load_library [cmd load_library]] call.
Generally, the [cmd -datafile] option should be passed to the
[cmd load_library] command if the only purpose is to access or update
resources.

[para]
When the resources in a module are no longer required, it must be
released through [uri process.html#free_library [cmd free_library]]
call.

[para]
Once the module is loaded, the content of a particular resource
can be retrieved using [uri #read_resource [cmd read_resource]]
and [uri #read_resource_string [cmd read_resource_string]].

[para]
You can also enumerate resources present in a module using the
[uri #enumerate_resource_types [cmd enumerate_resource_types]]
[uri #enumerate_resource_names [cmd enumerate_resource_names]]
[uri #enumerate_resource_languages [cmd enumerate_resource_languages]]
commands. The entire resource tree can be enumerated, optionally
retrieving the resource values, through the command
[uri #extract_resources [cmd extract_resources]].


[para]
Note that resources themselves do not need to be explicitly freed up.
In particular, [emph "do not try to close the resource handles"] through
the [cmd CloseHandle] or [uri handles.html#close_handles [cmd close_handles]].


[section "Updating Resources"]
Updating a resource in a file requires that the file not be in use
by any application (including the current process).
The [uri #begin_resource_update [cmd begin_resource_update]] command
prepares the file for update. One or more
[uri #update_resource [cmd update_resource]] commands can be used to
modify the resources in the file and
[uri #delete_resource [cmd delete_resource]] commands can be used to
delete resources.
Finally, the
the [uri #end_resource_update [cmd end_resource_update]] command
is used to commit or discard the modifications.

[section "String Resources"]
Strings defined through a string table definition in a resource definition
file are not directly stored in the resource binary. They are stored in
string blocks, each containing 16 strings. 
It is therefore not possible
to directly retrieve or update a string based on its string id.

[para]
If you call [uri #read_resource [cmd read_resource]] with a resource type of
[const 6] (STRING), the resource name or id has to actually be the id
of the string block, not the string. The command
[uri #resource_stringid_to_stringblockid [cmd resource_stringid_to_stringblockid]]
will take a string id and return a pair consisting of the id of the 
corresponding block and the index of the string within the block. The block
id can be passed to [uri #read_resource [cmd read_resource]] to read
the string block. Since this is in binary format, it needs to be converted
into a list of strings using
[uri #resource_stringblock_to_strings [cmd resource_stringblock_to_strings]].
The string index returned from 
[uri #resource_stringid_to_stringblockid [cmd resource_stringid_to_stringblockid]] can be used to then pick out the appropriate string from the this list.
[para]
If you are only interested in a single string, the command
[uri #read_resource_string [cmd read_resource_string]] encapsulates this
entire process.
[para]
Updating strings in a resource involves multiple steps for the same reason.
First, the string block has to be retrieved and converted to a list
of strings as described above. The list must then be modified as desired
and converted back to a string block using
[uri #strings_to_resource_stringblock [cmd strings_to_resource_stringblock]]
and then written out using [uri #update_resource [cmd update_resource]].
[para]
Deleting a string resource is similar. Once the list of strings in
the appropriate block is retrieved, set the corresponding element in
the list to an empty string before writing it back using
[uri #update_resource [cmd update_resource]].
[para]
A peculiarity in the storage format for resource strings means it is not
always possible to distinguish between a resource string that is not defined
and a resource string that is defined with an empty value. An attempt
to read an undefined resource string may either result in an error being
generated, or in the return of an empty string.

[section "Loading Resources as GDI objects"]

TWAPI also provides commands to load some resource types as GDI objects
whose handles are opaque but can be passed to other commands in the Windows
API. These include the commands
[uri #load_icon_from_file [cmd load_icon_from_file]],
[uri #load_cursor_from_file [cmd load_cursor_from_file]],
[uri #load_bitmap_from_file [cmd load_bitmap_from_file]],
[uri #load_icon_from_module [cmd load_icon_from_module]],
[uri #load_cursor_from_module [cmd load_cursor_from_module]],
[uri #load_bitmap_from_module [cmd load_bitmap_from_module]],
[uri #load_icon_from_system [cmd load_icon_from_system]],
[uri #load_cursor_from_system [cmd load_cursor_from_system]] and
[uri #load_bitmap_from_system [cmd load_bitmap_from_system]].

[para]
The handles returned by the above commands may be shared or unshared
(as described in the documentation for the specific command).
Unshared handles must be freed using 
[uri #free_icon [cmd free_icon]],
[uri #free_cursor [cmd free_cursor]] and
[uri #free_bitmap [cmd free_bitmap]] respectively. Shared handles
are automatically freed by the system and must not be passed
to the free commands.

[para]
The commands to load these GDI objects share a common set of options:

[list_begin opt]
[opt_def [cmd -createdibsection] [arg BOOLEAN]]
If [const true], returns a DIB section bitmap instead of a compatible
bitmap. Default is [const false]. This option is
only valid for bitmap resources.
[opt_def [cmd -defaultsize] [arg BOOLEAN]]
If [const false] (default) and
options [cmd -height] and [cmd -width] are not specified or
specified as 0, Windows will use the actual resource size. If
[const true], Windows will use the system metric settings.
This option is only valid for cursors and icons.
[opt_def [cmd -height] [arg INTEGER]]
Specifies the desired height of the icon or cursor. Default value is 0
in which case the width is controlled by the [cmd -defaultsize] option.
[opt_def [cmd -loadtransparent] [arg BOOLEAN]]
If specified as [const true], the color of the first pixel is replaced with
the default window color. Should be used only if the color depth is
8 bpp or less. Default is [const false].
[opt_def [cmd -monochrome] [arg BOOLEAN]]
If specified as [const true], returns a monochrome image. Default is 
[const false].
[opt_def [cmd -vgacolor] [arg BOOLEAN]]
If [const true], uses VGA color.
[opt_def [cmd -width] [arg INTEGER]]
Specifies the desired width of the icon or cursor. Default value is 0
in which case the width is controlled by the [cmd -defaultsize] option.

[uri process.html#load_library [cmd load_library]].
[nl]
Because of the storage format used in string resources, it is not always
possible to distinguish between a resource string that is not defined
and a resource string that is defined with an empty value. An attempt
to read an undefined resource string may either result in an error being
generated, or in the return of an empty string.

[call [cmd resource_stringblock_to_strings] [arg BINDATA]]
Converts a binary resource string block to a list of strings. As every
string block contains 16 strings, the returned list as exactly
16 strings.
